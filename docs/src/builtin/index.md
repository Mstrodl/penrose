# Built In Functionality

Out of the box, penrose offers a minimal amount of functionality that can be used
to write your own window manager. The core of the library is the state management
and X server interaction logic, but there are a number of types and traits available
for building out custom behaviour as you see fit.

Partly to exist as a reference (and also to bootstrap a minimal window manager) the
[builtin][0] module is provided with a small number of examples for each of the
pieces of functionality on offer.
