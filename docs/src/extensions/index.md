# Extensions

An extension is some piece of user written code that works with the penrose APIs to provide some
additional functionality. For specific, common use cases there are a number of traits and helper
functions that are available to do most of the heavy lifting (see the [builtin][0] section of this
book for examples of what is on offer). For things that are a little more custom, you'll want to
make use of the lower level `Hook` and `State Extension` APIs.

This section of the book gives an overview of the different APIs that are on offer and goes into
a little bit of detail around a couple of the commonly requested pieces of functionality that
penrose implements using them.
